	- Create repository
	- Add small benchmarks
		- double_inhibition.lp: 2 variables
		- repressilator.lp: 3 variables
		- repressilator_AS.lp: 3 variables (special version for change only asynchronous)
		- mammalian.lp: 10 variables
	
	- Rule class
	- Rule extraction from text file (LFIT OUTPUT syntaxe)
	- All transitions generation
	- Fixed number of random transions generation
	- Output transitions to stdout (LFIT INPUT syntaxe)
	- Debug info output to stderr
	
	Remarks:
		- Run with "python generator.py [FILE_PATH] [SEMANTIC] [NB_TRANSITIONS]*
		- example:
			- "python generator.py benchmarks/repressilator.lp synchronous > output.txt" generates all synchronous transitions of repressilator into output.txt
			- "python generator.py benchmarks/mammalian.lp asynchronous > output.txt" generates all asynchronous transitions of mammalian into output.txt
			- "python generator.py benchmarks/double_inhibition.lp general > output.txt" generates all general transitions of double_inhibition into output.txt
			- "python generator.py benchmarks/repressilator.lp synchronous 10 > output.txt" generates 10 random synchronous transitions of repressilator into output.txt
		- Output stdout to text file to get rid of the debug
		- Fix the number of transition for mamalian in general semantic otherwise too many transitions
		- Currently BOOLEAN variable ONLY
